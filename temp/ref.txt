cool manual : type rules and scope rules etc.
Tour of cool : functions of tree package
cool-tree.h : program_class definition

what to do?
	1) traverse AST
	2) gather info
	3) use those info (for type check, scoping etc.)

	Inheritance
		Implement inheritance graph and check for cycles
		Can stop compilation if error found
	Name ans Scope
		Use symbole table to manage scopes
		Recover from erros
		Classes, methods, attributes can be used before decleration
	Type checking
		See cool manual for type rules
		Recover from errors (Assign type Object)
	
	Must do
		set the type field of each expression node to Symbol (output off add_string method of id table)
		type of no_expr => No-type

	Error reporting
		Didn't understood 

	Files
		semant.h : declerations and definitons for SA (write)
		cool-tree.h : add field methods required for classes
		semant.cc : main file
